        This study is concerned with the development of breast cancer (BC) in
        women with a previous diagnosis of benign breast disease (BBD).  The
        study is prospective in nature.  The group of women available for study
        consists of 336 women with biopsy-proven BBD seen in a private practice
        in the Philadelphia area in the 1960s-1990s. A set of questions was 
        devised in 1962 and asked of all women enterring the study.  Study
        participants provided information on age and date of the initial diagnosis
        of BBD, side of BBD, parity and previous use of exogenous estrogens. 
        Follow-up to determine occurrence of BC was conducted through 1996 by
        the following methods: review of subsequent office visits, letters and
        telephone calls to study subjects, discussion with attending physicians, 
        and review of death certificates.  Additional information was ascertained 
        relative to age at menarche and menopause, age at birth of first child and 
        use of exogenous estrogens since initial episode of BBD in the private 
        practice.  Histological slides of the initial benign lesion from the
        vast majority of the women were reviewed in 1997 for classification of
        the benign lesions and subsequent BC's. This classification was done 
        in a uniform manner according to a predefined protocol by a panel of 
        pathologists who were blind to subsequent BC development. The data set 
        described below was created from the information as described above, but 
        does not include all of the original variables.  The data provided are 
        "clean" in the sense that: 
        1) it is the best available information that could be extracted from the
           original data; 
        2) there are no (or few) inconsistencies in the data (any problems that 
           one should be aware of are described next to the variables names) 
        3) the data should not need further cleaning/editing.




                                      VARIABLE EXPLANATIONS


          1.   ID# - self explanatory


          2.   E-AGE - age at BC or follow-up (calculated from age at entry,
                       date of entry and date of follow-up or BC and rounded
                       down to a whole number).

          3.   CANCER - indicator for breast cancer status at follow-up


          4.   DYRIB - year of first episode of BBD


          5.   BIOPSY - side of initial episode of BBD


               Variables 6-10 describe the histology of the womens'
               initial episode of BBD (type of lesions present).  Women
               with bilateral disease at entry have had the information
               from each biopsy combined.  As such it is possible for
               these women to have two FCD descriptors (variable #'s
               11-17) characterized as "predominant." Women with
               unilateral disease should only have one of these
               variables coded as "predominant."

          6.   INFLAM - inflammatory lesions

          7.   FAD - fibroadenoma

          8.   FCD - fibrocystic disease

          9.   INPAP - intraductal papilloma

          10.  OTHER - other

               Variables 11-17 describe the specific histologic
               features of FCD for women with FCD.

          11.  FC-CYS - cysts

          12.  FC-APM - apocrine metaplasia

          13.  FC-ADEN - adenosis

          14.  FC-SCAD - sclerosing adenosis

          15.  FC-EH/PP - papillomatosis (diffuse) and/or epithelial
                          hyperplasia

          16.  FC-INFL - inflammation

          17.  FC-CALC - calcification

          18.  AGEMENA - age at menarche

          19.  MCHILD - maximum number of children women reported
                        during her visits (Caution: this factor does 
                        not necessarily reflect the women's total 
                        parity as evidenced by the fact that according 
                        to it 29.9% of the women are nulliparious vs. 
                        21.8% as recorded in the factor AGEBCH which 
                        is ascertained at follow-up.)

          20.  AGEDX - age at initial diagnosis of BBD - it's the women's
                       age at entry into the study cohort

          21.  HORMX1 - indicator for whether or not women reported
                        using hormones (exogenous estrogens) prior to
                        her first episode of BBD (does not count use of 
                        the birth control pills, thyroid pills or "some")

          22.  FAMHIS - indicator for whether or not women reported a family
                        history of cancer at her initial episode

          23.  YRFU - year of BC or follow-up

          24.  TIME - number of months woman is on study (i.e. under
                      observation - its determined from the dates of
                      entry and the dates of follow-up)

          25.  AGEBCH - age at birth of first child for parous women

          26.  AGMENOP - age at menopause

          27.  HORMSF - indicator for whether or not women used
                        hormones (exogenous estrogens-includes oral
                        contraceptives, premarin, other specific
                        estrogens, and hormones of an unknown type)
                        since her first episode of BBD.
                        - Note: This variable is not one of
                        the original questions asked at follow-up,
                        rather it is derived from them in such a way
                        that it should reflect the above, however, one
                        should be aware of the fact that in certain
                        situations the date and age corresponding to
                        this use of hormones may be conservative (i.e.,
                        later than the actual date and age the women
                        first started using hormones)

          28.  AGEHR - age at which women first started using hormones
                       following her initial episode of BBD (must be 
                       >= AGEDX) - see remarks under variable #27

          29.  YRHR - year of first use of hormones following BBD
